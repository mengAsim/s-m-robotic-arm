task1: assembly of robotic arm
i have used in this task solidworks but its important to know that solidworks does not deal with .stl files so in order to use solidworks you have to change stl files to .sldprt ( there are alot of youtube video explain that) 
the first step in making the assembly of robotic arm was to bring the base and make it as (fixed position) part 
after that you can import all other parts and making the assembly by doing the mates between the parts
